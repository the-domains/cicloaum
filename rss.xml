            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Drinks: Smoked Manhattan</h1><p>Our good friends at Gin & Luck were kind enough to mix up a giant batch of Smoked Manhattan's for the WC-003 trip. When you can't have a fire, the next best thing is a fire in a flask. Here's the recipe for the mixologist in you.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/61b31e7329d9521e39e30d7f810f2557d817368f.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>'Bike to the Future': Design Museum Gent considers a world of two-wheeled design.</h1><p>'Bike to the Future' is the latest testament to a cycling revolution we've been witnessing since the 1960s. But the Design Museum Gent isn't interested in the past; between 25 March - 23 October it showcases a collection of contemporary models from the new millennium, including Philippe Starck's electric bike 'MASS' or Tobias Knockaert's laser-cut bicycle, and prototypes and experiments for the future, with unusual aesthetics, materials and functions.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/e75dd9b06e93c20d73aed8ffe8845b13b5208794.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Assignment of a Lifetime: Riding in a U-2 Spy Plane at the Edge of Space</h1><p>Back in 2010, San Francisco-based photographer Christopher Michel received a once-in-a-lifetime photo assignment from the US Navel Institute: to ride in the back seat of a U-2 spy plane at the "edge of space." At the plane's cruising and intelligence-gathering altitude of 70,000 feet above the ground, temperatures outside the plane fall to 70 degrees below zero.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/04f6c0633f5a485f90dde99e96cd653a67f86bd6.jpg"></article>]]></description>
